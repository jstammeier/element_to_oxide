# Define UI ----

# Define server logic ----

  # Define user specific objects inside 
  # server function, but outside of any render* calls. 
  # These would be objects that you think each user 
  # will need their own personal copy of. 
  # For example, an object that records the userâ€™s session information. 
  # This code will be run once per user
  
  output$selected_var <- renderText({ 
    
    # Only place code that Shiny must rerun to build an object 
    # inside of a render* function. 
    # Shiny will rerun all of the code in a render* chunk 
    # each time a user changes a widget mentioned in the chunk. 
    # This can be quite often.

# Run the app ----
